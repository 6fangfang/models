## Welcome to the MindSpore Model Zoo
### WHAT IS NEW:

- 2023.07.01: ðŸ”¥add [llm](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/official/README.md/#nlp) model (including hot glm/llama/bloom from mindformers)
- 2023.06.01: We've done code refactoring for classic SOTA models,modularized data processing, model definition&creation, training process and other common components with new lanched MindSpore CV/NLP/Audio/Yolo/OCR Series toolbox

- Old models were implemented by original MindSpore API with some tricks for training process speedup

- More information for model performance, please check [benchmark](benchmark.md).
